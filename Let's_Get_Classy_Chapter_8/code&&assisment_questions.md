### Theory-  
#### 1.How do you create Nested Routes react-router-dom configuration.
#### 2.React about createHashRouter,createMemoryRouter from React Router docs.
#### 3.What is order of lify cycle method calls in Class Based Components? 
#### 4.Why do we use componentDidMount? 
#### 5.Why do we use componentWillUnmount?Show with example
#### 6.(Research) why do we use super(props) in constructor?
#### 7.(Research) Why can't we have the callback function of useEffect async? 

### Coding- 
#### 1.Create a Class Based Component 
####  -Create 2 class bassed child components
####  -pass props from parent to child 
####  -Create a constructor 
####  -Craete a state variable inside child 
####   -use this.setState to update it. 
####   -What if there are multiple state variables? 
####   -Write a console.log for each lifycycle method. 
####   -Play with the console logs to find out the correct order of thir execution 
#### 2.Create interval inside componentDidMount? 
####   -Use clearInterval to fix the issue casued by that interval(componetWillUnmount).
